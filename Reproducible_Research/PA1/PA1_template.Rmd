Peer Assessment 1- Reproducible Research
========================================================

This is an R Markdown document, capturing the details about the Assignment 1 of the Coursera Class, Reproducible Research

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

First of all we will be reading the csv file called activity into a variable called 'activity'

## This is my first Knitr Assignment

### Reading the Activity Data into a Variable

```{r simulation, echo=TRUE}
activity <- read.csv('activity.csv', header = TRUE)        
```

### 1. Total number of steps taken per day

In this task, we will follow the following steps
1) Filter the records from the column 'steps' where values are NA
2) Convert date to Date format from factor
3) Aggregate the Steps on Date
4) Plot the Histogram

```{r read_plot, echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
act_clean <- filter(activity, is.na(steps)==FALSE)
#convert date to date format
act_clean$date <- as.Date(act_clean$date)
#Aggregate the steps by date
agg_act <- aggregate(steps~date, act_clean, sum)
#Plot the histogram
hist(agg_act$steps, col = 3, main = "Histogram of number of steps each day", xlab= "Total steps in a day")
```

### 2. Mean and Median of the total number of Steps taken per day

Calculating the mean and median of Number of Steps each day

```{r mean, echo=TRUE}
# Mean of the aggregated steps
mean(agg_act$steps)
# Median of the aggregated steps
median(agg_act$steps)
```

### 3. a) Calculating the Average Daily Activity Pattern

```{r average, echo=TRUE}
# Aggreating the Steps over the intervals
mean_act <- aggregate(steps~interval, act_clean, mean)
# Plotting the Steps and Intervals
plot(steps ~ interval, data = mean_act, type = "l", xlab = "Time Intervals (5-minute)", ylab = "Mean number of steps taken (all Days)", main = "Average number of Steps Taken at different 5 minute Intervals", col = "red")
```

### 3. b) Calculating the 5-minute interval, which on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps
```{r max_of_steps, echo=TRUE}
mean_act[which.max(mean_act$steps), ]$interval
```

### 4. a) Dealing with missing values

Here we need to count the total number of NAs in the dataset. First i will count the number of records without NA and will be subtracting that number from the total number of records
```{r NA_count, echo=TRUE}
NROW(activity)-NROW(na.omit(activity))
```

The total number of rows which contain NA values above is 2304

### 4. b) Replace the NA by mean for the 5 min interval, we will be creating the function which reads the data from data frae containing mean and will pass the value to another function which finds the NA

```{r Replace, echo=TRUE}
# perform the imputation
for (i in 1:nrow(activity)){
  if (is.na(activity$steps[i])){
    interval_val <- activity$interval[i]
    row_id <- which(mean_act$interval == interval_val)
    steps_val <- mean_act$steps[row_id]
    activity$steps[i] <- steps_val
  }
}

# aggregate steps as per date to get total number of steps in a day
table_date_steps_imputed <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity, sum)

# create histogram of total number of steps in a day
hist(table_date_steps_imputed$steps, col=3, main="(Imputed) Histogram of total number of steps per day", xlab="Total number of steps in a day")

# get mean and median of total number of steps per day
mean(table_date_steps_imputed$steps)

median(table_date_steps_imputed$steps)

# get mean and median of total number of steps per day for data with NA's removed
mean(mean_act$steps)

median(mean_act$steps)
```

Due to data imputation, the means remain same whereas there is slight change in median value.


## 5. Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

For this part the weekdays() function may be of some help here. Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.

1) Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

2) Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).

``` {r comparison, echo=TRUE}
# convert date from string to Date class
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")

# add a new column indicating day of the week 
activity$day <- weekdays(activity$date)

# add a new column called day type and initialize to weekday
activity$day_type <- c("weekday")

# If day is Saturday or Sunday, make day_type as weekend
for (i in 1:nrow(activity)){
  if (activity$day[i] == "Saturday" || activity$day[i] == "Sunday"){
    activity$day_type[i] <- "weekend"
  }
}

# convert day_time from character to factor
activity$day_type <- as.factor(activity$day_type)

# aggregate steps as interval to get average number of steps in an interval across all days
table_interval_steps_imputed <- aggregate(steps ~ interval+day_type, activity, mean)

# make the panel plot for weekdays and weekends
library(ggplot2)
